# Primer Search

This is a rails application that allows you to search for primers by sequence. Not sure what the limits are.

Things to do:

- check for hairpins, check for cross-annealing w/ other primer
- process fasta file
- run in background for massive jobs / email results link
- find more time than the current 24 hours a day max to complete more work
